# The_Apollo_5
## Project 3, Group 2

### Project Overview & Purpose:
#### We have created a program that allows the user to browse, interact, and learn facts about things NASA is tracking.  We were inspired by recent images from the James Web Space Telescope as well as older Hubble images to find out what types of things were in our "local" neighborhood, astronomically speaking.

### Instructions:
#### Our main page will display animated graphics, clickable images that update daily, as well as links to other interesting data sets.  The user will be able to navigate from our main page using either satelite, asteroid, or weather data links.  Some of these will allow the user to filter the data using drop-down menus, for example, the weather data page can be filtered for wildfires, volcanos, icebergs, and other data.

### Ethical Considerations:
#### Our data comes from an open government websites that contain no individual personal data.  The data does not seem to fall under copyright law as in that the data is offered freely to the public.  Our main ethical consideration has to do with documentation and attribution of our source code.  We have documented and attributed each source used in the creation of this project to the best of our abilities.
